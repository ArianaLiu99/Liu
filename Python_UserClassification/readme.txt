There are fifteen .py files and two .ipynb files in my supporting documents.
The Data_pre-processing.py file is the code for data pre-processing. The twelve Neural_Network.py files are the code for single neural network systems. User_grade_pre.py is the code for ensemble learning.User1_future_pre.py is the code for prediction data analysis of the first user.
The two .ipynb files, User_grade_pre.ipynb and User1_future_pre.ipynb, contains the code and simulation results of the two corresponding .py files.
